![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- VSCode
- Webpack
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Linters
- Async/Await
- API Knowledge
- Babel

## Setup

- Get the link of the repository 
- Clone it as `git@github.com:arthurborgesdev/leaderboard.git`

## Info

- For this exercise, a previous game named "Matchmaking Stickman" was created in Insomnia
- This process yielded the id of `xxluFQBeRwbN9ctGU2td` which was hardcoded in the code

## API Information

- This application uses the [Leaderboard API service](https://www.notion.so/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3) provided by Microverse

- The base URL is `https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/`

- It has basically 2 endpoints, `/games/` (to create games) and `/games/:id/scores/` (To create and get scores)

- To create a game, send a POST action to the base URL + `/games/` with the name of the game:

```
{
  "name": "This is the name of the new game" 
}
```

- The result will be something like: 
``` 
{
	"result": "Game with ID: Zl4d7IVkemOTTVg2fUdz added."
}
``` 

- To create a new score, send a POST action to the base URL + `/games/:id/scores/` (where id is the previous id of the created game) and the score and user name:

```
{
  "user": "Arthur"
  "score": 42 
}
```

- To get a list of all scores for a specific game, send a GET action to the base URL + `/games/:id/scores/`:

- The response will be something like:

```
{
  "result": [
    {
      "user": "John Doe",
      "score": 42
    },
    {
      "user": "Peter Parker",
      "score": 35
    },
    {
      "user": "Wonder Woman",
      "score": 50
    }
  ]
}
``` 

## Usage

- Run `npm install` on a Terminal to install the modules
- Run `npm run build` on a Terminal to build the assets using webpack
- Run `npm run start` on a Terminal to start the server and look at the result in `localhost:8080`
